	<h1>Quick hummus recipe </h1>
	<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. </p>
	<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads. </p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 can (400g) of <i>chick peas (garbanzo beans)</i> </li>
		<li>175g of tahini 6 <em>sundried tomatoes</em></li>
		<li>Half a red pepper </li>
		<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
		<li> 1 clove of garlic</li>
		<li>A dash of olive oil</li>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
			<li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
			<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
			<li>Process all the ingredients into a paste <ol type="a"><li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time </li>
				<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time </li></ol></li>
				<li>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. </li>
				<li>Experiment and see what works for you.</li>
			</ol>
				<h3>Storage</h3>
				<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. </p>
				<p>You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it.</p>
				<p> If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>
				<p id="lastp">Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
